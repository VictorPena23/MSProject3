This is a small patients list for nurses to log in patients. We built this MERN STACK with Authentication. We used a static method for hashing passwords with bcrypt. Json Web Token was also used to authenticate login users. We used validator to make sure the email and password are valid before entering the app. You can sign up and log in. You must be signed in to view patients list, if not logged in you will be given an error. You must have valid password or you will be given an error. You can add patients once logged in and also delete patients, only when logged in. This app was tested through postman. It uses mongoo DB for storing data with patients and users.
